Bionca’s Strengths – Troubleshooting, Works better fixing errors.
Jae’s Strengths – Planning, asking for help
·        How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
We will use these strengths to work together to build the application.
·        In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
Ability to Plan better, Handling Ambiguity
·        Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
Comments in the code, asking each other questions, working on the same thing at the same time.
Conflict Resolution
·        What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
Talk about the situation.
·        What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
Talk about the situation. Agree to compromise more.
·        How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We will approach this with kindness, empathy, and positive intent.
